# Introduction to Capella

## What is Capella

Capella is an Eclipse project and an open-source MBSE tool and method to sucesfully design system architecture, providing a comprehensive, indistrial-grade and customizable solutions to engineering teams worldwide.
For more information about Capella, you can refer to https://mbse-capella.org

Capella embeds the Arcadia methodology, a method devoted to Systems and Architecture Engineering, that supports understanding of customer needs, definition and sharing of system architecture, and early validation and verification. 
It consists of four major perspectives, with their own goals, that provide guidance along the different of the architecture design process, and featuring a clear distinction between need and solution. The four main perspectives of Arcadia are the following:
- Operational Analysis: What the users of the system need to accomplish. In this step, the architect will define the problem by identifying the system users and actors (human and non-human) who will operate with the system, as well as their operational activities and capabilities.
- System Analysis: What the system has to accomplish for its users. This steps focuses on the system to be designed, the formalization of its requirements and the definition of its functions, that will ensure it can fulfill the user needs (defined at the previous step).
- Logical Architecture: How the system will work to fulfill the expectations. In this perspective, architects build a coarse-grained component breakdown of the system carrying most important engineering decisions, and which is unlikely to be challenged later in the development process.
- Physical Architecture: How the system will be developed and built. This steps defines the system's final architecture. After this step, the system is considered ready to develop for subsequent engineering specialties.

## Installing and running Capella

To run Capella, go to the download page (https://mbse-capella.org/download.html) and download the zip corresponding to the latest release of Capella.
Once the download is complete, you can simply unzip it to the location of your choice (preferably using 7zip). Then, run capella.exe in the Capella folder.

## Opening the Capella model

To open the Capella model, check first that you have the folder locally saved on your device.
Then, in Capella, go to the File menu and select "Open Projects from File System", then click the Directory button, select the root directory in which the .aird file of the project is contained, and click "Finish".
You can then open the project and show the diagrams by double-clicking the .aird file of the project.
